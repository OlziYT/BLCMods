1.0.2 Changelog:

• Fixed a bug regarding Snowman DLC and Halloween DLC to scale to a minimum level 5 instead of 15. This would unintentionally not spawn any loot from the Snowman Chest. This has been fixed.
• Fixed the bug with Binary Boss not dropping Pearls in UVHM. This has been fixed.
• Revamped and reworked Axton's skill trees to be a bit more functional. Heavy changes were implemented into the Guerrila Turret and Demolition Man Trees, but Black Ops tree mostly remains unchanged with the exception of Mag-Lock, which now provides Shield Stats to Axton when Turret is deployed.
• Decreased the amount of Magazine Size acquired from Backup Magazine. The Ammo Regen however, is left untouched.
• Addressed a reported concern that some single shot Shotguns (Slow Hand/Swordsplosion) were not firing projectiles. This has been fixed.
• Fixed Jakobs Pistols to not have the clunky animation.
• Increased Deathtrap's base Melee Damage.

• Increased Loot Midget Drop Chance from base 25% to 75%.
• Reverted the lost EXP gains for enemies 6 levels above you. Also adjusted the EXP formula for after Level 50 to be less severe.
• Changed the Critical Scaling of weaponry. Also adjusted the base value of certain weapons for their Critical stats. Hyperion parts now increase bonus Crit by 15% instead of .25x. Also removed Crit DMG Attributes from Rocket Launcher guns as they generally cannot Crit.
• Addressed a reported concern that Rocket Launchers were not receiving Ammo Regeneration. This has been fixed.
• Addressed a reported crash with the Outbreak Perfected. This has been fixed.
• Changed the Hard Light's Child Projectiles so that they don't veer all over the place and miss their target.
