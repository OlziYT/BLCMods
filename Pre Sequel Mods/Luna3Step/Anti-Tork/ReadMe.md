Replaces all tork spawns

Notes
- During the quest, Sub Level 13 Part 2, you will need to reload the game after collecting the first record. This is because a tork usually spawns to open a grate for you to progress but I cannot find a way to open the grate without spawning the tork
- Sometimes a tork swarmling will spawn for no apparent reason, its only ever been one at a time in my testing and its very rare
- The friendly tork at the end of Sub Level 13 Part 2 that spawns if you decide to save Schmidt still spawns
- The ghosts that spawn in Sub Level 13 are still in the game, I opted to keep them in as they don't act as torks
- A few quests and bosses were reworked to make this mod work
- I am open to requests for replacing/removing other enemies if they trigger any phobias, DM me on discord (threestepauthentication) and let me know what you need
